Implement a code that simulates a smart plant care system focusing on the "Add a new plant to the system" functionality. This functionality allows the user to input details for a new plant, which are then stored in the program.

Create a program that simulates a smart plant care system.
The program should provide a menu to the user with the following options:
a. Add a new plant to the system
b. Update plant information
c. Search for a plant
y. Exit
Please note that the full program will have all these options. However, certain grades will
contain only a part of this menu. The program should utilise loops and conditional statements
to ensure the proper flow of actions.

a. Add a new plant to the system:
• Prompt the user to enter the plant's name, species, watering schedule, and sunlight
requirements.
• Generate a unique ID for the new plant.
• Store the plant details (ID, name, species, watering schedule, and sunlight
requirements) using individual variables. For example, you can define variables such
as plantID for the unique plant ID, plantName for the plant's name, plantSpecies for
the species of the plant, wateringSchedule for the watering schedule for the plant
(e.g., daily, weekly), and sunlightRequirements for the sunlight requirements for the
plant (e.g., full sun, partial shade).
• You need to provide screenshots of your code and the different outcomes it can give based
on user inputs.
• Your Word document should have appropriate headings to ensure that this task can easily
be identified alongside the rest of your work.
